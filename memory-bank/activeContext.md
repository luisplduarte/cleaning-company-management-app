# Active Context

## Current Focus
Expanding system capabilities with advanced features. Core management systems (clients, jobs, workers) are complete, and now implementing analytics, calendar integration, and payment tracking. Dashboard provides data visualization with charts for job distribution and worker efficiency.

## Recent Decisions
1. Using Next.js App Router for modern React features
2. Implementing authentication with NextAuth.js + Supabase
3. Using Prisma as ORM for type-safe database access
4. Implementing RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for admin/worker separation
5. Implementing form validation with react-hook-form and zod
6. Using toast notifications for user feedback

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Project Setup
1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Configure Tailwind CSS
3. Set up Supabase project and database schema
4. Create Prisma schema and generate client
5. Configure authentication system

   - List view implementation ✓
   - Worker-job assignments ✓
5. ~~Dashboard views for different roles~~ ✓
   - Jobs distribution chart ✓
   - Worker efficiency metrics ✓
   - Key performance indicators ✓

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
1. Real-time updates
2. Notifications system
3. ~~Calendar integration~~ ✓
   - Job scheduling view ✓
   - Event management ✓
   - Loading states ✓
   - Error handling ✓
4. Mobile responsiveness
5. ~~Analytics and reporting~~ ✓
   - Dashboard charts ✓
   - Payment tracking system ✓
