# Active Context

## Current Focus
Optimizing and enhancing the core management systems. Client, job, and worker management features are implemented with full CRUD capabilities, now focusing on improving integration and performance between these systems.

## Recent Decisions
1. Using Next.js App Router for modern React features
2. Implementing authentication with NextAuth.js + Supabase
3. Using Prisma as ORM for type-safe database access
4. Implementing RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for admin/worker separation
5. Implementing form validation with react-hook-form and zod
6. Using toast notifications for user feedback

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Project Setup
1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Configure Tailwind CSS
3. Set up Supabase project and database schema
4. Create Prisma schema and generate client
5. Configure authentication system

### Phase 2: Core Features
1. ~~User authentication and authorization~~ ✓
2. ~~Client management CRUD operations~~ ✓
   - Client data model ✓
   - Form implementation ✓
   - API endpoints ✓
   - List view implementation ✓
3. ~~Job management CRUD operations~~ ✓
4. ~~Worker management CRUD operations~~ ✓
   - Worker data model ✓
   - Form implementation ✓
   - API endpoints ✓
   - List view implementation ✓
   - Worker-job assignments ✓
5. Dashboard views for different roles

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
1. Real-time updates
2. Notifications system
3. Calendar integration
4. Mobile responsiveness
5. Analytics and reporting

## Project Insights

### Architecture Decisions
- Server components for better performance
- API routes for data mutations
- SWR for client-side data fetching
- Zustand for complex UI state
- Repository pattern for database access

### Implementation Focus
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Type safety across the application
- Responsive and accessible UI
- Secure data handling
- Efficient database queries

### Key Patterns
- Component composition for UI
- Custom hooks for shared logic
- Service layer for business logic
- Repository pattern for data access
- Middleware for request handling

## Active Considerations

### Security
- Role-based access control
- Secure authentication flow
- Protected API routes
- Input validation
- Error handling

### Performance
- Server-side rendering
- Optimized database queries
- Image optimization
- Code splitting
- Caching strategies

### User Experience
- Intuitive navigation
- Responsive design
- Loading states
- Error messages
- Form validation

## Current Challenges
1. Optimizing database queries for listing views
2. Improving job scheduling and assignment workflows
3. Implementing worker availability tracking
4. Enhancing integration between workers, jobs, and clients
5. Adding real-time updates for job status changes

## Learning Points
1. Next.js App Router patterns and server components
2. Supabase integration best practices
3. TypeScript type safety and schema validation
4. Prisma schema design and relationships
5. RBAC implementation
6. Dynamic route handling in Next.js 14
7. Database migration management
