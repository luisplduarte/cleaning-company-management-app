# Active Context

## Current Focus
Setting up the initial project structure and core functionality for the cleaning services management application.

## Recent Decisions
1. Using Next.js App Router for modern React features
2. Implementing authentication with NextAuth.js + Supabase
3. Using Prisma as ORM for type-safe database access
4. Implementing RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for admin/worker separation

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Project Setup
1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Configure Tailwind CSS
3. Set up Supabase project and database schema
4. Create Prisma schema and generate client
5. Configure authentication system

### Phase 2: Core Features
1. User authentication and authorization
2. Client management CRUD operations
3. Job scheduling and management
4. Worker assignment system
5. Dashboard views for different roles

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
1. Real-time updates
2. Notifications system
3. Calendar integration
4. Mobile responsiveness
5. Analytics and reporting

## Project Insights

### Architecture Decisions
- Server components for better performance
- API routes for data mutations
- SWR for client-side data fetching
- Zustand for complex UI state
- Repository pattern for database access

### Implementation Focus
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Type safety across the application
- Responsive and accessible UI
- Secure data handling
- Efficient database queries

### Key Patterns
- Component composition for UI
- Custom hooks for shared logic
- Service layer for business logic
- Repository pattern for data access
- Middleware for request handling

## Active Considerations

### Security
- Role-based access control
- Secure authentication flow
- Protected API routes
- Input validation
- Error handling

### Performance
- Server-side rendering
- Optimized database queries
- Image optimization
- Code splitting
- Caching strategies

### User Experience
- Intuitive navigation
- Responsive design
- Loading states
- Error messages
- Form validation

## Current Challenges
1. Efficient job scheduling algorithm
2. Real-time updates implementation
3. Complex state management
4. Data synchronization
5. Mobile-first design approach

## Learning Points
1. Next.js App Router patterns
2. Supabase integration best practices
3. TypeScript type safety
4. Prisma schema design
5. RBAC implementation
